# RVIC API

Almost all of RVIC is available via a public API.

```Python
import rvic
```

Most of the internals of RVIC are stored int the `rvic.core` module:

```Python
from rvic.core import latlon2yx
```

More coming soon!  For now, take a look at the [RVIC github repository](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/RVIC).
