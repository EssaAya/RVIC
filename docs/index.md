# Welcome to the RVIC Streamflow Routing Model

The RVIC streamflow routing model is an adapted version of the model the model typically used as a post-processor with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model. The routing model is a source-to-sink model that solves a linearized version of the Saint-Venant equations. This model, developed by Lohmann et al. (1996, 1998a, 1998b), has been used in many offline studies at a variety of spatial scales.  Furthermore, the development of the impulse response functions (IRFs) is done as a preprocessing step, which considerably reduces the computation time in subsequent steps.
